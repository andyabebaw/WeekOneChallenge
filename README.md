# Week One Challenge

## Description

This website was built to provide an overview of what Horiseon Social Solution Services provides. Building this site we wanted to provide a simple and easy to use experience to showcase the different services in detail and allow new potential clients to understand who we are and what we do.  Before building this site clients would need to reach out to an employee to find out the answers to their basic questions but this sites resolves that issue in and easy to use way.  Further details can be found by reaching out to our staff. Through building this site I learned how to condense down HTML and mainly CSS by using class selectors properly and efficiently as well as debug simple mistakes such as broken links.
